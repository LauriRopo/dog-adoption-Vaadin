WORK IN PROGRESS

This is a Dog Adoption Platform created as part of a school project for a Java Vaadin course. The web application serves as an interactive platform where users can browse available dogs for adoption and submit adoption requests. It is designed with two main user roles: general users and admin users, each with distinct capabilities.

Features:
User Functionality:

Browse Available Dogs: Users can explore a list of dogs available for adoption. The platform displays essential information about each dog, such as breed, age, temperament, and health status.

Adoption Request Submission: Once users find a dog they are interested in, they can submit an adoption request form. This form allows them to provide details about their household, living situation, and why they want to adopt the dog, enabling better matching between adopters and dogs.

Admin Functionality:

Dog Management: Admin users have the ability to add new dogs to the platform, including essential details like breed, size, age, and any special care instructions. They can also modify existing dog profiles, ensuring the information remains up-to-date and accurate.

Adoption Request Management: Admins can view and manage all submitted adoption requests. This includes reviewing the applicant's information, processing requests, and updating the status of each adoption application.

Technology Stack:
The application is built using Java and the Vaadin framework, providing a robust and user-friendly interface for both administrators and general users. Vaadin's components and layout system offer a seamless experience for developing interactive web applications without requiring a separate front-end framework.

This project demonstrates the use of modern web technologies for building real-world applications while learning about UI design, data management, and user roles in a web-based system.
